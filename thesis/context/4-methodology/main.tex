This chapter details the architecture and workflow of our proposed \textbf{{\framework}} framework.
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:framework_overview}, {\framework} is an end-to-end pipeline designed to address the challenges of incomplete data, high training costs, and inefficient inference in a unified and synergistic manner.
The entire framework can be understood as a four-stage process: \\
(1) Robust Data Imputation \\
(2) Parallel Teacher-Student Preparation\\
(3) Teacher Training\\
(4) Architecture-Aligned Reliable Knowledge Distillation. \\
The subsequent sections will delve into the technical details of each core module.

    \caption{\textbf{The overall architecture of the {\framework} framework.} The process begins with imputing the incomplete feature matrix via \textbf{APCFI}. In parallel, a powerful GNN teacher is trained on the recovered data, while the \textbf{MPP} module generates a pruned, lightweight MLP student. Finally, the \textbf{MP-KRD} module distills knowledge from the teacher to the student, producing a final model that is both robust and efficient for inference.}
