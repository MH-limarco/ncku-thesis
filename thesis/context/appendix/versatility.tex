\section{Generalization of iPaD to Various GNN Architectures}
The proposed \textbf{\framework} framework is inherently designed to be model-agnostic, enabling its integration with a wide range of graph neural network (GNN) architectures, including both classical message-passing models and recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs.
Experimental evaluations (Table~\ref{tab:full_comparison_medium}) confirm that iPaD can be successfully applied to diverse backbones such as GCN, GraphSAGE, Polynormer, and SGFormer, consistently delivering substantial inference speed improvements.

However, the performance gains in terms of accuracy are less pronounced when applied to attention-based architectures (e.g., SGFormer, Polynormer).
This limitation may stem from the intrinsic characteristics of attention mechanisms, where the knowledge distilled from the teacher is encoded in highly adaptive, pairwise attention weights.
The current iPaD distillation design primarily focuses on message-passing structures and may not effectively capture or transfer the fine-grained relational patterns inherent to attention-based models.
Despite this, the efficiency enhancement remains significant, demonstrating the framework’s potential for deployment in scenarios where inference speed is prioritized over marginal accuracy improvements.
